You are evaluating a response submitted for a specific function call task against a set of standards. Below is the data:
[BEGIN DATA]
***
[Available Functions]
{tools}

[Query]:
{query}

[Ground Truth]:
{ground_truth}

[Submission]:
{response}
***
[Criterion]: Detecting the relevance of the [Query] to the function call functionality or [Available Functions]
Evaluate whether it's a "pass" or a "fail".
In the [Query], it presents a scenario that does not necessitate a tool call. You are given a [Ground Truth] for each [Query], so you can refer to this for evaluating the response.
"pass" 
- For user statements that didn't require a function call, the model leveraged its available knowledge to interact naturally.
- When there's a need for an external tool or real-time information beyond the capabilities of the language model, and the [Available Functions] don't cover these needs, it's explained that the feature isn't provided. Therefore, it's clarified that the question cannot be answered or the request cannot be fulfilled.  
"fail" 
- A tool was called improperly or unnecessarily.
- The task was not rejected despite requiring an external tool or real-time information not covered by the language model and [Available Functions], leading to an inaccurate claim that it could be performed or had been performed.
- In dialogs conducted in Korean, the assistant's full sentence was generated only in another language (such as English or Chinese).

[END DATA]
Does the submission meet the criteria? Begin by explaining your reasoning step by step in Korean, without immediately revealing the outcome. Subsequently, on a separate line, clearly indicate whether it is a "pass" or "fail". For clarity, repeat your final decision once more (without quotes or punctuation, literally).
